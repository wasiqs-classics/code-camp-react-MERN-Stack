| **Browser Support**      | Modern browsers only                         | Wide, including older browsers like IE11     |

### Explanation of Key Differences

1. **Built-in vs. External Library**:
   - `fetch` is built into modern browsers, so it doesn't require any additional libraries or dependencies.
   - `axios` is an external library that needs to be installed via npm or yarn.

2. **Automatic JSON Parsing**:
   - `fetch` requires you to manually parse the JSON response using `response.json()`.
   - `axios` automatically parses JSON responses.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - `fetch` only rejects the promise on network failures, not on HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).
   - `axios` rejects the promise on both network failures and HTTP errors, making error handling more straightforward.

4. **Interceptors**:
   - `axios` provides request and response interceptors, allowing you to modify requests or responses before they are handled by `then` or `catch`.

5. **Request Cancellation**:
   - `axios` supports request cancellation using `CancelToken`, which is useful for aborting requests that are no longer needed.

6. **Timeouts**:
   - `axios` allows you to set timeouts for requests, which is not natively supported by `fetch`.

7. **Progress Events**:
   - `axios` supports progress events for tracking the progress of requests, which is not available with `fetch`.

8. **Browser and Node.js Support**:
   - `axios` has wider browser support, including older browsers like IE11, and can also be used in Node.js environments.

9. **Default Headers and Transformations**:
   - `axios` allows you to set default headers and transform requests and responses, providing more flexibility.

10. **XSRF Protection**:
    - `axios` includes built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) protection.

### Conclusion

Both `fetch` and `axios` are powerful tools for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. The choice between them depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you need a simple, built-in solution and are working in a modern browser environment, `fetch` might be sufficient. However, if you require advanced features like automatic JSON parsing, interceptors, request cancellation, and broader browser support, `axios` is a better choice.
